Hmm-mm, hmm-mm-mm
I know they don't like me that much
Guess that I don't dress how they want
I just wanna be myself
I can't be someone else
Try to color inside their lines
Try to live a life by design
I just wanna be myself
I can't be someone else someone else
They yell, they preach
I've heard it all before
(Heard it all before) be this, be that
I've heard it before heard it before
Big boys don't cry shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin stand out, fit in
Good girls don't fight be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in
Lately, it's been too much all day
Words shot like a cannon at me
I just wanna be myself
I can't be someone else someone else
They yell, they preach
I've heard it all before
(I've heard it before) be this, be that
I've heard it before heard it before
Big boys don't cry shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin stand out, fit in
Good girls don't fight be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in
I am who I am no matter what
(No matter what, no) never changing
No matter what no matter what
Big boys don't cry shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin stand out, fit in
Good girls don't fight be you, dress right
White face, tan skin stand out, fit in
Big boys don't cry shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin stand out, fit in
Good girls don't fight be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in
